# Repo containing episode wise codes for The Cherno's OpenGL Series

Known issues (or differences from the series/my mistakes) - 
1. Vertex buffer in the series has the name "position" while in my codes it is written as "positions"
2. Header file for the renderer i.e. "Renderer.h" is, in my code, mistyped as "Renderder.h" for reasons beyond my understanding
3. In one of the commits, parameter "float deltaTime" of the OnUpdate() function in the Test.h file is mistyped as "delatTime". Just that one commit.
4. Some code for episode 25 might be overriden by code of episode 26 as I forgot to commit changes for episode 25.

Be careful with the above while referencing/copying my code
